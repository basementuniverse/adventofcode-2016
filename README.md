# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016), written in Javascript. Output is via <code>console.log()</code>.

Most of the scripts will output solutions for both parts 1 and 2, for others you will need to uncomment/modify some lines.

## Notes

Day 1 solution uses [vec2.js](https://github.com/basementuniverse/vec2) by [me](https://github.com/basementuniverse).

Day 2 solution uses [vec2.js](https://github.com/basementuniverse/vec2) by [me](https://github.com/basementuniverse).

Day 5 solution uses [md5.js](http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/javascript/md5-text.html) by Joseph Myers. It also uses Web Workers, so you'll probably need to run it from localhost rather than file://.

Day 11 solution <code>solve.htm</code> runs out of memory before reaching the solution. The solution I used is based on an observation by reddit user [/u/bovard](https://www.reddit.com/user/bovard).
